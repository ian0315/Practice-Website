      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>World War II was the deadliest and biggest war ever fought in history that affected nearly every part of the world. 
        It spanned from the years of 1939-1945 and was a result of around 40-50 million total deaths. 
        It pitted the Axis and Allied powers against each other, where they would fight across Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. 
        It resulted in a number of notable battles, the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the first use of atomic weapons. 
        This website will explore moments, battles, and the lasting impacts of the war.

        <h3>Why did the war start?</h3>  
        The reason for the start of this war stems back to the unresolved issues as a result of the First World War. 
        <ul>
          <li>The Treaty of Versailles</li>
          After the end of the First World War in 1919, more than two dozen countries gathered in France in order to create a treaty that would establish the end of WWII. 
          The countries that had lost the war were not able to attend this conference. This caused resentment from Germany, being the largest and most powerful of the defeated countries.  
          By the end of the discussion, it was decided that Germany needed to take the blame for the war, give up colonies and territory, limit the size of its army and navy, and pay for financial damages to the countries that had won. 
          <li>The Rise of Fascism</li>
          WWI left Germany in a fragile state. Many Germans believed they could have won the war if they had not conceded defeat and the blame was pinned on Jews and leftists. 
          Germany also fell into hyperinflation, ruining their economy, which was then followed by the Great Depression. All of this combined with many other reasons immensely boosted the support for the far-right Nazi party into power. 
          They spread the promise that they would tear up the Treaty of Versailles, fix the country's horrible economy, restore Germany to what it once was, and attain more power, creating a strong and pure Germany. 
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        These combined with a multitude of other reasons caused an inevitable fate. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. In the following days and weeks, countries continued to declare war on each other, beginning the Second World War.
