          The war left the world in a bad state, having killed over 60 million people, with most of those being civilians. 
          Major cities around the world like Berlin, Tokyo, and Dresden were destroyed and left in pieces. 
          Homes were destroyed, economies were fragile, and major food shortages were just some of the major issues people were facing.
          Holocaust survivors in Europe also had nowhere to go and had to become refugees. 
          All in all, countries had major work to try and rebuild to a stable state. 
          Fortunately, the U.S. still had its economy intact and was able to support fixes in both Europe and Asia through the Marshall Plan. 
          <br><br>
          Many countries took between 5-10 years to regain stability and rebuild the destruction that occurred.
          Heavily damaged countries such as Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union took much longer to recover to a normal state, leading into the 1950s and 60s. 
          Although buildings and money can be made back, millions of people will have physical and emotional scars for the remainder of their lives.
          Soldiers who fought will have trauma and PTSD that cannot be fixed no matter how long. 
          War does irreversible damage and reminds the world to resolve conflicts peacefully and do everything to avoid wars in the future.

          The results of the war made world leaders realize an organization was needed to prevent future global conflicts. 
          This then led to the creation of the United Nations being established on October 24, 1945, with 50 different countries signing the charter. 
          This organization replaced the League of Nations which failed to prevent the second world war. 
          The organization aimed to focus on countries cooperating, human rights, maintaining peace, and settling disputes without violence. 
          Spanning until now, the United Nations includes nearly every single country in the world and plays an important role in global problems.

      <h2>The Holocaust</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          After World War II, everyone was able to learn about the atrocity that was the Holocaust. 
          The Nazi party of Germany organized a mass movement of Jews to concentration camps by arresting them, having them do forced labour, and then mass killings. 
          This all went down during the heat of war, and although it was known that groups were being taken, we did not understand the intent until the liberation of these camps. 
          When it finally happened, Allied forces found mass graves with piles of bodies, gas chambers, and weakened, tortured, survivors. This is when they fully understood the extent of the situation. 
          <br><br>
          These discoveries caused the Nuremberg Trials. Nazi leaders and associates were tried in court for the horrendous crimes that they had committed during the war. 
          This was the first of its kind of trial, where eventually, many high-ranking Nazi officials were sentenced to death, while others received lengthy prison sentences. 
          This held those accountable for the horrific acts they committed and led to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.
