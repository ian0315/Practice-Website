      <h2>Pearl Harbour Attack</h2>
      <div class = "text">
        <p>
          The Attack on Pearl Harbour happened on December 7, 1941, and Japan launched a surprise air strike on an American naval base in Hawaii. 
          The strike destroyed many ships and aircraft while killing over 2300 Americans. 
          This planned-out attack was meant to weaken the U.S. naval fleet because of Japan's plans to expand their empire as they did not want the U.S. to be a problem. 
          This, however, was a turning point in the war that backfired on Japan. It caused the U.S. to officially enter the war the following day.
          The attack instead caused the U.S. to come back with even stronger military power, eventually helping the Allies defeat Japan and the Axis powers.

      <p>The Battle of Normandy, occurring in 1944, lasted from June 6 to August 21. 
        It was a major operation by the Allies during the war and was a mission to liberate territory in Europe that was under Nazi control.
        Over 156,000 Allied soldiers stormed the 5 beaches along the French coastline. 
        There was heavy resistance from the German side, causing massive casualties on both sides of the battle. 
        Eventually, Allied forces were able to break through the German lines and gain control of Normandy. 
        <br><br>
        Canadian forces played a huge part in this invasion with over 14,000 Canadian soldiers landing on the beaches that day.
        D-Day was such a big deal as it started the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. 
        This major development allowed for the further liberation of Europe from Nazi control, and eventually end the war. 
        Although much progress was made, it came with a price. There were over 200,000 Allied casualties with around 20,000 of those being Canadian. The Germans faced over 300,000 casualties before being defeated.

      <h2>The Battle of Stalingrad</h2>
      <div class = "text">
        <p>
          The Battle of Stalingrad is one of the deadliest and most important battles of the Second World War lasting from August 1942 to February 1943.
          It was fought between Germany and the Soviet Union to gain control of the city of Stalingrad. 
          The battle had fierce fighting and bombing and resulted in massive casualties on both sides of the battle. 
          German forces were advancing early in the battle, but as the Soviets held on, they were able to surround and defeat the Germans.
          This was the first major defeat for the Germans and caused a push for the Allies. Not only was morale and momentum on their side but much of the German forces and supplies were heavily depleted. 
          The territory was able to be maintained by the Allies and turn the tides of the war.
